## Feasibility Study
The feasibility of the project depends on three factors: **material research**, **bioreceptivity research**, **design research**, and **impact research**.

### Material Research: PLA
According to studies, it takes about 80 years for PLA to decompose naturally (source: https://3dinsider.com/is-pla-biodegradable/).
Under ideal composting conditions, this can be reduced to several months or a few years, a great timescale for plant development.
According to a survey done by the German Environmental Aid on almost 1000 composting plants in Germany at least a year ago, about 95% of them are not qualified to handle composting of bioplastics according to set environmental standards (source: https://3dinsider.com/is-pla-biodegradable/).

The decomposition of PLA is influenced by several factors:
* **Temperature.** Ideal temperature is between 50 to 60 degrees Celsius.
* **Moisture.** Ideal moisture is between 50 and 70%. Excessive moisture can hinder the degradation process.
* **Oxygen.** PLA is an aerobic biodegradable material, so adequate oxygen levels facilitate its breakdown.
* **pH.** A slightly acidic pH (from 6 to 7) is favorable.
* **Presence of Microorganisms.** Microorganisms like bacteria and fungi play a crucial role, since thye produce enzymes that can break down the polymer chains.

Out of these factors, we can't control temperature, moisture, or pH.
Oxygen is a given.
We may be able to increase the presence of bacteria and fungi by "seeding" the material before releasing it to the wild.

***TODO. List of types PLAs and their bioreceptivity properties.***

### Bioreceptivity Research
***TODO.***

### Design Research
***TODO.***

The design should be "porous, labyrinthic, and water-retentive".
Should be able to hold buffers and micro-climates.

### Impact Research
***TODO.***
